## 2024-05-22 - Accessibility of Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like 'Favorite' or 'Font Size') are invisible to screen readers without ARIA labels, creating a barrier for visually impaired users.
**Action:** Always add `aria-label` and `title` attributes to buttons that rely solely on iconography to convey their purpose.
